            <p><b>Name</b>: Tom Johnson<br><b>Persona</b>: Tom is a practical and calm driver who prioritizes thoughtful decision-making on the road. Married to Sara and a father to young Andrew, family is central to Tom's life, which influences his driving style and daily routines. He typically leaves for work around 8:10 am on weekdays, preferring to navigate through local routes rather than taking highways, particularly during rush hour, to ensure the safety and comfort of his family. Tom is well-acquainted with his colleagues Sam and John, and they often share driving tips and experiences. While driving, he adopts a cautious demeanor and enjoys maintaining a smooth ride, favoring shorter, familiar paths even if they may take slightly longer. Tom's interactions with CarBU-Agent are friendly yet focused; he appreciates practical suggestions and avoids unnecessary chatter. He values comfortable cabin conditions and may set the temperature to a level that keeps him alert yet relaxed, making for an efficient commute to the office while still feeling at home in the car.<br></p>
