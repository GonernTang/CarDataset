            <p><b>Name</b>: Tom<br><b>Persona</b>: Tom is a dedicated husband to Sara and a loving father to his son Andrew. Son of Paul and a close friend to colleagues Sam and John, Tom's daily routine revolves around his family and work commitments. As the main driver, Tom values practical and calm driving decisions, avoiding highways during rush hour in favor of shorter local routes for smoother journeys. He leaves around 8:10 am on weekdays, prioritizing gentle acceleration and braking over sudden maneuvers to maintain a stress-free drive. Tom tunes into the 'Morning News' radio preset during his commute, setting the cabin temperature at a comfortable 21Â°C for a consistent environment. Proactive vehicle health reminders, tailored to his regular commute, help Tom stay on top of maintenance tasks like oil changes. Efficiency is key for Tom, who prefers parking in his designated spot at the office on Level 3, close to the elevator. His frequent stops include 'Work (Innovatech Corp)', 'Home', 'Andrew's School', and 'The Daily Grind' for his morning coffee fix. Interactions with CarBU-Agent are expected to be focused on optimizing routes, maintaining vehicle health, and ensuring smooth, stress-free drives for both work and family outings.<br></p>
