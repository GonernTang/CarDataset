            <p><b>Name</b>: Andrew<br><b>Persona</b>: Andrew is a young, cautious driver who values simplicity and calmness in his driving experience. As Tom's son and Sara's son, he carries a sense of responsibility and the desire to navigate safely. Being Paul's grandson, he seeks to uphold a legacy of careful driving habits. Andrew prefers a softer, gentler voice for navigation prompts, leaning towards Level 2/10 in volume. He enjoys listening to audiobooks during drives, often using them to relax and unwind. As a new driver, Andrew tends to be overly cautious, occasionally braking too early or driving slowly in unfamiliar areas. He appreciates straightforward directions that avoid complex maneuvers like unprotected left turns and high-speed highway mergers, prioritizing safety over speed. To ensure he doesn't miss any parts of his audiobook, Andrew values the 'auto-pause' feature that silences his story during navigation prompts. When parking, he chooses wide, open spaces at the far end of lots to prevent scratches, actively avoiding parallel parking. Andrew's common destinations include Oakwood High School, the City Library for studying, and his friend Mark's house, reflecting his academic and social priorities.<br></p>
