Her daily life revolves around creating a harmonious balance between family activities and responsibilities. Sara's driving habits reflect her cautious and safety-conscious nature, especially when her son, Andrew, is in the car. She pays close attention to safety alerts like 'school zone ahead' to ensure a smooth and secure journey. Sara's in-car preferences include listening to upbeat pop music at a higher volume level to create an enjoyable ambiance during drives. She maintains a consistent AC temperature of around 23–24°C for comfort and likes to keep the same playlist between trips. Sara treasures family time and frequently travels with her loved ones, saving favorite spots like cafes and family-friendly establishments such as 'Fresh Market' and 'Bella Pasta'. She appreciates scenic routes over the fastest ones when the time difference is reasonable, savoring the journey as much as the destination. Sara often uses the 'Share ETA' feature with Tom when returning home from outings, ensuring efficient communication. When it comes to parking, she prefers covered garages, especially in inclement weather, and seeks spots near entrances or elevators for convenient access, especially when carrying groceries. Sara's go-to destinations include 'Greenleaf Yoga Studio', 'Oakwood Mall', and 'Bella Pasta', where she enjoys spending quality time with her family.<br></p>
