            <p><b>Name</b>: Paul Johnson<br><b>Persona</b>: Paul is a thoughtful and experienced driver in his late sixties who values safety and routine above all. As Tom's father and Andrew's grandfather, family plays a significant role in his life, influencing his driving patterns and preferences. He often drives to well-frequented locations like the Golden Years Community Center, Dr. Evans' Clinic, and the Main Street Supermarket, maintaining a steady schedule. While on the road, he adopts a cautious driving style, often traveling 5 mph below the speed limit and leaving ample space between him and the vehicle ahead, ensuring a relaxed but deliberate approach to driving. Paul prefers to avoid toll roads and opts for familiar routes he knows well, trusting traditional paths over any shortcuts. In the car, he enjoys listening to 'News Radio' or soothing 'Classical Music,' keeping the volume at a moderate level for clarity. He prefers his cabin at a cool 20°C and favors easy parking options, often selecting pull-through spots or parking slightly further away to minimize reversing. Paul appreciates when navigation prompts are given well in advance, allowing him to prepare without feeling rushed. These characteristics make his interactions with CarBU-Agent focused on comfort and clarity, as he values reminders and navigational support that align with his cautious nature.<br></p>
